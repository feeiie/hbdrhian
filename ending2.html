      Finally, you completed this website. Through it, you remembered so many memories between us.  
      <strong>All of them are precious to me.</strong>  
      Even the moments that aren’t written here—I remember them too.
    </p>

    <p>
      We talked every day, did live calls, laughed, and made each other happy.  
      But from now on, <strong>we need to spend more time thinking about our future than our past.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      After your graduation, we will meet again and share happy moments together.  
      I don’t know if everything in our future will go smoothly—our languages and the places we live might be different.
    </p>

    <p>
      But please, <strong>don’t feel sorry if I’m alone sometimes.</strong>  
      I finally found someone I can trust and feel truly comfortable with.  
      Even if it's hard to speak perfectly, <strong>I want to stay with you until the day we die—together.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      I once lost a close friend when I entered high school.  
      After that, I started spending time with "Imokenpi."  
      We knew each other since junior high, but our relationship wasn’t very deep.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Imokenpi, we were just friends who passed time.  
      <strong>But when I met you… I didn’t expect we would become so deeply connected.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Now, you’re the only one I truly trust.</strong>  
      You’re not just my best girlfriend—you’re the person I want beside me forever.  
      <strong>Even after I die, you’ll still be my one and only.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      I appreciate you so much.  
      Never think that I dislike you or am angry with you.  
      <strong>I know how deeply you care about me—and that’s one of the biggest reasons I love you.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      I know you also have many reasons for loving me.  
      And I feel the same.  
      <strong>Anyway… Happy Birthday, Rhian.</strong>  
      You’re getting older, and maybe school uniforms don’t suit you anymore…  
      <strong>But you’re still the cutest girl—too cute for any clothes.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>I’m so excited to live with you. I love you rhian.</strong>
